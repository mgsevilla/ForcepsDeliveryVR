# Project Description

The World Health Organization recommends a rate of cesareans inferior than 15%. 
However, the actual rates in the US double this value, while the use of obstetrical instruments,
a recommended alternative to cesareans but which requires high skill and experience, has significantly decreased in the latest years. 
In this context there is a clear demand for simulators, with special interest in learning the correct use of Kielland’s forceps.

In 2018, we developed a training software in 3D Slicer for the correct use of forceps.
We used anatomical simulators of the mother and fetus, a forceps 3D printed in non-ferromagnetic material, and an electromagnetic tracking system to track the movements of the forceps relative to the simulators.
Further details can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-01201-4_9).

The goal of this project is to translate this software into a Virtual Reality (VR) application using the SlicerVR extension. This way, only the VR device is required for training.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Visualize the simulators and forceps models in the VR scene.
2. Interact with the models using the controllers.
3. Select the step of the procedure.
4. Check whether the maneuver for the step is correct or not.
5. Enable a collaborative mode.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Visualize the simulators and forceps models in the VR scene.
2. Define a correct starting viewpoint.
3. Decide how to move the forceps with the VR controllers.
4. Learn how to access buttons from the controllers.
5. Define a way of selecting the step for the procedure (assembly, presentation, initial placement, final placement). A panel could be a good idea.
6. For each step, check whether the placement was correct or not (at an instant or in real time).
7. Connect to the same scene from other device.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
